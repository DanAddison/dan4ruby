This is our wedding site!

It is a public website but it has SEO optimizations stripped out - it is targeted specifically at our invited guests.

This is where guests can find information so that they know what to expect and can plan accordingly.

It is also where they will send their RSVP responses, and ultimately it will remain online as an image gallery to document the big day.
