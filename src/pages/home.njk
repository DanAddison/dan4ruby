          <p>There is no parking at the factory - in fact all of the surrounding streets are usually chock-a-block. Let's try not to annoy the neighbours!</p>
          <p>Pretty much all of us are local so can easily plan alternative transport - for any out-of-towners (anyone?), Folkestone West station is 5 minutes walk away.</p>
